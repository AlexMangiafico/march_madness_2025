## Why March Madness?

March Madness is one of the most exciting and unpredictable events in sports, but also the tournament most publicly forecasted by the general public. Every year tens of millions of bracket submissions attempt to predict the outcomes of the 134 games making up the Men's and Women's tournaments. From flipping a coin to picking chalk, from elo models to vegas odds, from team colors to school mascots, every strategy under the sun has been employed to better predict how successfully a bunch of 20 year olds will throw a round orange ball into a round orange hoop. And we're here for it, every year, rain or shine.

## Opening Thoughts

College sports present a unique challenge becuase the talent disparity between powerhouse programs and small schools is so large. Nowhere in professional sports do we see athletes walk into the stadium facing such insurmountable odds as a 16 seed in March Madness. Further, the conference structure of college athletics means that in the regular season we get lots of data points where teams are somewhat evenly matched, but only a few early in the season with a talent disparity even close to what we see in March. Further, the changing landscape of college athletics with respect to NIL deals and the transfer portal has led to ever-shifting distributions of talent, shaking up an unstable equilibrium that had been in place for decades. Any framework to address this modeling problem has to take into account strength of schedule, growth of player skill over the course of a season, and how teams/players might match up against one another, among a host of other concerns.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to train a model that can predict the outcome of any college basketball game played in the future. These will be moneyline predictions, handicapping each team's chances to win the game, though similar methodology could be employed to predict margin of victory or points total. This output was chosen to match the submission format of Kaggle's annual [March Madness Machine Learning Mania]([https://www.ncaa.com/march-madness](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025)) competition, which I enter to compare my predictions to those of other models.
