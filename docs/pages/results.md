## Predictions for the 2025 Tournament

With confidence in our model's ability to predict past tournaments, we applied it to the **2025 NCAA Tournament field** to generate **win probabilities** for each matchup.

### Key Predictions:
- **Potential Cinderella Teams**: Our model highlights a few lower-seeded teams with **higher-than-expected chances** of advancing past the first two rounds.
- **Overrated High Seeds**: Some **top seeds are flagged as vulnerable** based on their inefficiencies in key advanced metrics.
- **Final Four Projections**: The model provides the highest-probability path to the **Final Four**, balancing win probability with potential upsets.

## Visualizing Win Probabilities and Brackets

### Win Probability Matrix

Below is a heatmap of **win probabilities for each team**, illustrating **how likely each matchup is to go in favor of a given team**.

- **Darker squares** indicate stronger favorites.
- **Lighter squares** highlight toss-up games where upsets are more likely.

### Bracket Simulation

Using **10,000 tournament simulations**, we generated a predicted bracket based on the most probable **Final Four** and **National Champion**.

Key observations from our bracket simulations:
- The **most probable champion** has a **~24% chance** of winning, while no team exceeds **25%**, reflecting the tournament's inherent randomness.
- The **Elite Eight** is dominated by teams with strong **offensive efficiency rankings**, reinforcing the importance of offensive production in deep tournament runs.

## Conclusion

Through **backtesting** and **2025 tournament predictions**, we demonstrated that our **logistic regression model** effectively identifies **strong contenders and potential upsets** based on advanced metrics. While no model can perfectly predict March Madness, our data-driven approach provides a **competitive edge over traditional bracket strategies**.

Weâ€™ll continue refining our model as the tournament progresses, incorporating **real-time performance updates** and **adjusting probabilities based on in-game statistics**.

Stay tuned for **live updates and model recalibrations as the tournament unfolds!**
