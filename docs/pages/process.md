# Project Process

### 1. Data Collection
The first step involved gathering data from various sources, including historical game results, player statistics, and other relevant features.

### 2. Data Cleaning
We cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in the dataset.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Key features such as team performance metrics, player stats, and game-specific variables were engineered for model input.

### 4. Model Selection
Several machine learning models were tested, including logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks.

### 5. Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall, using a train-test split and cross-validation techniques.
