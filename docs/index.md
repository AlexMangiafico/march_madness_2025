Welcome to my March Madness 2025 project! This site is a writeup of work done between March 1st and March 20th to predict college basketball games and submit to Kaggle's March Machine Learning Mania competition. This particular modeling task is a pet favorite of mine, going back to high school when I first predicted basketball games for a class project. This year I began with the hypothesis that predicting games with offensive and defensive efficiencies is a good approach but one that leaves out a lot of the details crucial to specific matchups. I attempted instead to quantify each team's ability to create and prevent different underlying statistics during basketball games, and then I used those ratings as features to predict future game outcomes. I invite you think critically about my process, my analysis of the results, and what could be improved as you read on. My final code for this project, as well as some of the notebooks I used along the way to experiment and create visualizations, are viewable in this project's [github repository](https://github.com/AlexMangiafico/march_madness_2025).
